<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The visualization shows the relation between the number of refugees 
seeking asylum in switzerland between the years 1986 and 2015 and 
regional world events (mostly wars). The impact of various regional
events is explored.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>First draft:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I first tought about using a line diagram, since the data is essentially
a time series. But since I wanted to show for each year the regional
decomposition of refugee origin, I found that a stacked bar chart worked
better while retaining most of the time series feel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The x axis spans the years 1986 to 2016. The y axis spans from 0 to a little
more than the maximum refugee count (i.e. 50&#39;000). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Second draft:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The draft chart was way to hectic and colorful. Thus, I reworked the data to
include only the top 10 origin countries for each year and I grouped these
years into six large regions of origin (e.g. middle east, north africa, east
africa, ...) This reduced the visual clutter substantially, while providing
additional insight into the data. This makes sense, since most event that result
in waves of refugees (e.g. wars) concern not only one country but rather a whole
region.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add value labels to the stacked bars</p>
</li>
<li><p>Order data so that &quot;Other&quot; is lowest and the other regions are consistently
arranged.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add more descriptive axis labels</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add more descriptive title and subtitle</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add information about major event in this period (regional wars)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Place the legend to the bottom of the dashboard</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Final version</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I realized due to feedback from a udacity reviewer, that I was
supposed to create a story that explained the data and not just to create
a single visualization. This led me to rethink the whole project and I
settled on a slightly different path.</p></li>
<li><p>I solely use line charts. These work very well for time series
data.</p></li>
<li><p>I start with a line chart that shows the overall numbers. Then, in
subsequent story panels, I focus on different regions of the world and
explain the relation between peaks and event in the particular region.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, all the charts are combined in a stacked line chart. This
chart does not have labels for the values, since it would be too cluttered.
Also, the purpose of the chart is mainly to show the qualitative development
of the values over time and their relation with world events.</p></li>
<li><p>All charts share the same vertical axis, ranging from 0 to 50'000.
This provides an immediate visual comparison of the various charts.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, I translated the whole visualization from german to english</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>(Feedback was given orally by Nils. Nils is a colleague at work.)</p>
<p>Feedback for first draft:</p>
<p>Chart is too cluttered. The overall trend is visible, but it is
difficult to see detail information.</p>
<p>Feedback for second draft:</p>
<p>Chart gives a good idea of the large refugee counts during the
balkan wars.</p>

The jbead_full.csv file contains data about the usage of
the jbead program. This program is used to design bead
crochet ropes and can be downloaded for free from
www.jbead.ch

Each time the application is started, it checks whether
there is a newer version available. If it is, then the
user is prompted to install and use the newer version.

This update check is logged in the web server access
log. I took the data from the years 2013 through 2015
(i.e. three full years), cleaned the data and resolved
the ip data to geographic information. This clean and
tidy data set was used for the project.
